## üöÄ Overview

**TUD MaxTools** is a powerful ExtendScript for Adobe Illustrator designed to significantly enhance your productivity when working with multi-artboard documents. This script automates the process of adding dynamic text elements like page numbers, current dates, timestamps, and file-specific information (full path or just file name) to all artboards in your active document.

Its intuitive user interface allows you to precisely control placement (top/bottom), alignment (left/center/right), and margins, giving you perfect control over the final output. While primarily built for page numbering, its flexible text insertion capabilities make it ideal for adding any consistent information across your artboards, saving you valuable time and ensuring project consistency.
